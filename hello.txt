Absolutely! Here’s a broader set of questions covering not just scanning but other important areas such as reporting, integrations, security, compliance, performance, and usability to assess Wiz.io’s overall capabilities:

### 1. **Scanning and Detection**
   - **Scanning Coverage**: Does Wiz.io scan all types of data sources (databases, cloud storage, SaaS apps, etc.) equally, or are there differences in depth or frequency for each type?
   - **Efficiency**: How does Wiz.io handle large data sources in distributed environments (e.g., big data systems)? Are there specific performance improvements in place for scanning big data?
   - **Real-Time Monitoring**: Does Wiz.io offer real-time monitoring for newly created data? If so, how does it balance real-time data security checks with overall system performance?

### 2. **Data Classification and Sensitivity**
   - **Classification Models**: How does Wiz.io classify sensitive data? Are classification models pre-built, customizable, or trained based on specific data patterns from the customer’s environment?
   - **Industry-Specific Classifications**: Are there built-in data classifications for industry-specific sensitive data (e.g., financial data, healthcare records, etc.)? Can new data types be added based on organizational needs?

### 3. **Integration and Automation**
   - **Existing Tools Integration**: How does Wiz.io integrate with existing security tools like SIEMs, SOAR platforms, or DLP solutions? Are there native connectors, APIs, or third-party integration capabilities?
   - **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: Can Wiz.io be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to ensure security during development and deployment? If so, how does it flag security issues in real-time as code and data models evolve?
   - **Automation**: Does Wiz.io support automated remediation actions (e.g., revoking access, alerting security teams) when sensitive data is exposed? How customizable are these automated actions?

### 4. **Reporting and Insights**
   - **Report Customization**: How customizable are Wiz.io’s reports? Can users tailor reports based on specific regulatory frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS), data types, or internal policies?
   - **Actionable Insights**: How actionable are the insights provided by Wiz.io? For example, are specific remediation steps suggested when risks are identified?
   - **Report Accuracy**: How does Wiz.io validate the accuracy of its reports, especially when identifying sensitive data and flagging risks? Are there periodic reviews of data accuracy in reports?

### 5. **Security and Compliance**
   - **Data Protection and Privacy**: How does Wiz.io protect the data it processes during scans? What encryption methods are in place both in transit and at rest?
   - **Compliance Alignment**: How does Wiz.io help organizations comply with regulatory requirements? Does it have out-of-the-box support for common frameworks (e.g., CCPA, ISO 27001)? Can the compliance checks be customized?
   - **Auditability**: Does Wiz.io provide audit logs for all actions taken on sensitive data, including who accessed the data, when, and what changes were made? Are these logs tamper-proof?

### 6. **Data Handling and Retention**
   - **Data Retention Policies**: How does Wiz.io handle the retention of sensitive data discovered during scans? Are there customizable data retention policies in place?
   - **Sensitive Data Storage**: Does Wiz.io store any sensitive data as part of its analysis? If so, what controls are in place to ensure that this stored data is protected?

### 7. **User and Access Management**
   - **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: How granular are the role-based access controls in Wiz.io? Can administrators assign different permission levels for various users or teams (e.g., read-only vs full access)?
   - **Access Management for Sensitive Data**: How does Wiz.io help manage and audit who has access to sensitive data across the organization? Can it trigger alerts if users gain unauthorized access to sensitive data?

### 8. **Performance and Scalability**
   - **Scaling for Large Environments**: How does Wiz.io scale in large, complex environments? Does it support horizontal scaling to accommodate larger datasets without performance degradation?
   - **Latency Impact**: What is the typical impact of Wiz.io’s scans on system performance in high-transaction environments (e.g., e-commerce platforms, financial trading systems)? What steps are taken to minimize latency?
   - **High Availability**: How does Wiz.io ensure high availability and redundancy, especially when scanning critical data stores in production environments?

### 9. **User Experience and Usability**
   - **Ease of Use**: What is the overall user experience like for administrators and security teams using Wiz.io? Is the UI intuitive, and how much training is required to get started?
   - **Customization**: How customizable is the interface and dashboards? Can security teams tailor dashboards to their specific needs and priorities (e.g., by data type, risk level, or compliance standard)?
   - **Visualization of Risk**: Does Wiz.io offer data visualization features to help users easily understand data risks and security posture (e.g., heat maps, risk scores, trend graphs)?

### 10. **Data Discovery and Inventory**
   - **Automated Discovery**: How does Wiz.io automate the discovery of new and existing data stores in the environment? Can it detect shadow IT data sources that may not be officially cataloged?
   - **Inventory Management**: Does Wiz.io provide a complete inventory of data sources, including metadata, security configurations, and risk levels? How frequently is this inventory updated?

### 11. **Incident Response**
   - **Incident Correlation**: Does Wiz.io integrate with incident response tools to correlate identified risks with ongoing security incidents? How quickly can it provide insights during an active security incident?
   - **Root Cause Analysis**: How does Wiz.io assist with root cause analysis when sensitive data is exposed? Does it provide forensic data for investigating breaches?

### 12. **Training and Support**
   - **Training Resources**: What kind of training resources does Wiz.io offer for new customers (e.g., webinars, documentation, or in-person training)? Is there a learning path for different roles, such as security analysts or administrators?
   - **Customer Support**: What levels of customer support are available (e.g., basic vs premium support)? How responsive is the support team to critical issues during and after implementation?

### 13. **Innovation and Roadmap**
   - **Product Development**: What upcoming features or improvements are on the product roadmap? Are there planned enhancements to core features like data discovery, scanning, or compliance reporting?
   - **Customer Feedback Loop**: How does Wiz.io gather customer feedback for future improvements? Is there a formal mechanism for customers to request new features or enhancements?
